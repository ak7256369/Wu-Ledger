# Wu Ledger - Codespaces Quickstart

This project is optimized for GitHub Codespaces.

## 1. Initialize the Chain
Run the setup script to install Ignite, scaffold the chain, and apply the custom AMM module logic.

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

To start the chain:
```bash
cd wuledger
ignite chain serve
```

## 2. Start the Dashboard
In a new terminal:

```bash
chmod +x setup_frontend.sh
./setup_frontend.sh
```

The dashboard will be available at port 3000.

## Project Structure
- `wuledger/`: The Cosmos SDK blockchain (generated by setup.sh).
- `frontend/`: Read-only Next.js dashboard.
- `x/market/`: Custom "Math Only" AMM logic source files (injected by setup.sh).
