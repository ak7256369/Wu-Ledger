# Wu Ledger - Codespaces Quickstart

This project is optimized for GitHub Codespaces.

## 1. Initialize the Chain
> **Note for Codespaces Users:** The environment is automatically set up when the codespace is created. You can skip this step and proceed to "Start the Chain".

If running manually:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

To start the chain:
```bash
cd chain
ignite chain serve
```

## 2. Start the Dashboard
In a new terminal:

```bash
cd ..  # If you are in the chain directory
chmod +x setup_frontend.sh
./setup_frontend.sh
```

The dashboard will be available at port 3000.

## Project Structure
- `chain/`: The Cosmos SDK blockchain (generated by setup.sh).
- `frontend/`: Read-only Next.js dashboard.
- `x/market/`: Custom "Math Only" AMM logic source files (injected by setup.sh).
