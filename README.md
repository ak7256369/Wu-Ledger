# Wu Ledger - Codespaces Quickstart

This project is optimized for GitHub Codespaces.

## 1. Initialize the Chain
> **Note for Codespaces Users:** Once the Codespace opens, you **MUST** run the setup script manually to install dependencies.

```bash
./setup.sh
```

To start the chain:
```bash
cd chain
ignite chain serve
```

## 2. Start the Dashboard
In a new terminal:

```bash
cd ..  # If you are in the chain directory
chmod +x setup_frontend.sh
./setup_frontend.sh
```

The dashboard will be available at port 3000.

## Project Structure
- `chain/`: The Cosmos SDK blockchain (generated by setup.sh).
- `frontend/`: Read-only Next.js dashboard.
- `x/market/`: Custom "Math Only" AMM logic source files (injected by setup.sh).
