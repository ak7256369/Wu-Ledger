# Wu Ledger - Codespaces Quickstart

This project is optimized for GitHub Codespaces.

## 1. Initialize the Chain
> **Note for Codespaces Users:** Once the Codespace opens, you **MUST** run the setup script manually to install dependencies.

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh setup_frontend.sh
./setup.sh
```

To start the chain:
```bash
cd chain
ignite chain serve
```

## 2. Start the Dashboard
In a new terminal:

```bash
cd ..  # If you are in the chain directory
chmod +x setup_frontend.sh
./setup_frontend.sh
```

The dashboard will be available at port 3000.

## Project Structure
- `chain/`: The Cosmos SDK blockchain (generated by setup.sh).
- `frontend/`: Read-only Next.js dashboard.
- `x/market/`: Custom "Math Only" AMM logic source files (injected by setup.sh).

## Troubleshooting

### Git Sync Issues in Codespaces
If you see an error like `Your local changes ... would be overwritten by merge`, it means your Codespace has an older or modified version of a file. To fix this and match the repo exactly:

```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```

### Port Not Found
If the frontend cannot connect, ensure the chain is running (`ignite chain serve`) and that port **1317** is active in the "Ports" tab of VS Code.
